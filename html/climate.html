    <p><em><strong>Climate change has already caused significant impacts in the USA.</strong> </em> The average temperature has increased by 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit since the early 20th century. This has led to more intense heatwaves, wildfires, and other extreme weather events.</p>

    <h2>Future Impact of Climate Change in the USA</h2>
    <p>In the future, the USA is expected to experience more frequent and severe weather events, such as hurricanes and droughts. Sea levels are projected to rise by 1-4 feet by 2100, affecting coastal cities. The local ecosystems will face disruptions, impacting biodiversity.</p>

    <h2>Minimizing the Impact</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduce carbon emissions by transitioning to renewable energy</li>
        <li>Implement sustainable agricultural and industrial practices</li>
        <li>Promote energy efficiency and conservation measures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Local Actions Against Climate Change</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Community tree planting initiatives</li>
        <li>Local policies promoting green energy</li>
        <li>Educational programs about sustainability</li>
    </ul>
